Hi, CCS!
Thanks for your amazing workshop on webDev, it really helped me learn quite a few things and
helped me create this webpage.
All of this was created by myself without use of any kind of template from net and with some use of bootstrap.I spent neaely 10 hrs in the library to create this, hope you like it!
 It was tough understanding how to get the parallax effect of scrolling in my website, but after alot of tries i was able to comeup with a solution that was too fix the background image.
I implemented all that you wanted us to try..
